#IonPopSolver
IonPopSolver solves the time-dependent ionization equations for a particular element given tabulated values of the plasma electron temperature and density. These tabulated values can be the solutions of an analytical model, the output from a numerical simuation, or a set of observational measurements. A full description of the numerical model and relevant physics can be found in [Bradshaw (2009)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...502..409B).
##Dependencies
IonPopSolver has been successfully tested and run on Mac OS X, Linux (Ubuntu 14.04), and Windows. It is recommended that Windows users use the Unix environment provided by <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>. This will make installing the relevant dependencies and compiling the code much more simple. The following are required dependencies for compiling and running IonPopSolver:

### Installing Boost on Windows
While the Boost libraries can be downloaded using the Cygwin package installer, building and linking has proved difficult. The best and simplest way for Windows users to acquire the Boost libraries is just to download the source code and build the one needed library, <tt>program_options</tt>.

+ First, download the Boost libraries tarball from [source](http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_55_0.html). Download the `.tar.gz` (we'll assume this is called `boost_1_55_0.tar.gz`) file for the Unix platform into a convenient directory `$DOWNLOADS`. 

+ Untar the compressed source (can take __several minutes__) and change into the uncompressed directory.
```Shell
    $ cd $DOWNLOADS
    $ tar xvzf boost_1_55_0.tar.gz
	$ cd boost_1_55_0
```

+ Next we need to configure the build of the `program_options` library. Make sure to include the `--with-libraries` flag. Run `./bootstrap.sh --help` if you want to see all available command line options.
```Shell
    $ ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=program_options`
```

+ Finally, we want to run the actual install script which has been generated by `./bootstrap.sh`. __This will take a long time, ~30 minutes.__ This will both build the `program_options` (static) library, move the library files to `/usr/local/lib` and the header files to `/usr/local/include`.
```Shell
    $ ./b2 link=static install
``` 

##Downloading and Compiling
Change into the directory where you want to build the model (e.g. `$HOME`) and download IonPopSolver through the `git` command line utility by running
```Shell
    $ cd $HOME
    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/rice-solar-physics/IonPopSolver.git
```
This will pull down a local copy of IonPopSolver at `$HOME/IonPopSolver`. The `--recursive` flag will automatically download and update the relevant submodules `$HOME/IonPopSolver/Radiation_Model/, $HOME/IonPopSolver/rsp_toolkit/, $HOME/IonPopSolver/rsp_toolkit/tinyxml2/`. To pull down any future updates to IonPopSolver, run `git pull` in `$HOME/IonPopSolver`.

To compile, run
```Shell
    $ scons
```
This will use the `$HOME/IonPopSolver/SConstruct` file to build an executable and place it in `$HOME/IonPopSolver/bin`. __Note:__if `scons` fails because it cannot find the Boost libs or headers, you may need to adjust `CPPPATH` and `LIBPATH` in `$HOME/IonPopSolver/SConstruct`.

To clean up the object files and the executable, run `scons -c`. You can find more advanced SCons options by running `scons --help`.
